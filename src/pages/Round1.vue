        We are seeking interesting and innovative dapps, along with

      <h2>What is the timeline for applications?</h2>
      <p>
        The grants process will be open for applications at some point in
        January 2023.  That application process will remain open through February,
        March and April.  Decisions on which grants will be funded will be made in May.
        Those decisions will be made public and funds disbursed in June.
