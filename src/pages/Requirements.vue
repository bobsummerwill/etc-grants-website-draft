      <h1>What do grant applications need to know?</h1>

      <h2>No Retroactive Funding</h2>
      <p>
        We will <b>not be considering</b> applications seeking to retroactively
        claiming funding for already completed projects, or to compensate
        individuals for prior volunteer work.  This program is intended to
        spur new development, whether from new entrants or existing ecosystem
        participants.
      </p>

      <h2>Projects must be open source</h2>
      <p>
        All projects must make their "outputs" available using permissive open
        source licensing (Apache 2, Mozilla MPL 2 or Creative Commons).
        Funding will not be provided for projects seeking to build proprietary
        solutions.  The copyright will remain with the authors, but licensing
        must be permissive and patents must not be filed on the outputs of
        these projects.
      </p>

      <h2>Progress Reports</h2>
      <p>
        Applicants are obliged to provide two status reports.
        The first report will be mid-project and the second report is due at
        the completion of the project, or when work towards its stated goals
        comes to an end for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        These reports will all be made public, as will the proposals themselves,
        together with feedback and rationale from the committee on each of the
        proposals explaining how their merits were assessed and how that
        assessment informed the decision-making process for allocation of funds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first status report will be due 6 weeks after the funds are released,
        so around the end of January.  The final status reports will be due
        mid-February.  The intention for the program is for everything to be
        completely transparent so that applicants can see which proposals are
        having success, likely "market rates" for proposals and so on.
